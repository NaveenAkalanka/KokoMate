KokoMate

KokoMate is a mobile-first progressive web application (PWA) and native Android calculator engineered specifically for Sri Lankan shoppers utilizing the "Koko" Buy-Now-Pay-Later payment gateway. It solves the frustration of hidden fees and unclear payment schedules by instantly generating mathematically exact initial cash obligations, monthly recurrence splits, and total merchant surcharges via a highly responsive and native-feeling user interface.
